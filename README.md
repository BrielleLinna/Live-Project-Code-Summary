Adding Donor List Dropdown/ Link Dropdown/ Link to Nav Bar
This story required me to add in a new NavBar section for the currently existing page, Donor List.  The purpose of this was to allow the admin or back end user of this functioning website a quick link to a list of Donors using the NavBar only seen by the admin user.

Here is an example of the image provided as a launching point:
